# Twitter-Spam-Detection---AI course - Machine learning
The aim of this project is to learn about machine learning techniques and apply them to real-life applications.

The main task is to develop an automated tweet spam detector by pre-processing the data, extracting features, and building different classifiers (Decision tree, Naive Bays, and Random Forest ).
Testing of data will be carried out using a Python program with the help of the Scikit-Learn and using Google Collaboratory.
